0.6.2 to 0.6.3 (28/09/2021)
* Add LTO to build process
* Add _executable flag to DSO cache
* DSO cache is populated with all regions, not just executable ones
* Add PID-by-PID throttling to DSO backpopulate requests, since these requests
  are numerous, expensive, and beyond a single invocation per sample, do not
  improve unwinding quality--the throttle limits backpopulate to the soonest
  of once very 200 samples or once per export
* Fix bug where the lifetime of an mmap()'d region was bound to the lifetime
  of the RegionHolder temporary, causing DSO reads to fail
* Resequence the setuid() mmap maneuver so that an mmap() is attempted with
  current UID before switching
* Filter PID 0 before it hits any of the ddprof worker functions, since we
  currently don't handle it at all
* Fix buggy exit in application start when an invalid argument is given
* Add an overflow check to the unwinding memory_read interface 
* Add some backpopulate and region holder unit tests
